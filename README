testing apple's speech quotas and limits

SpeechRecognitionTaskState:
  starting = 0
  running = 1
  finishing = 2
  canceling = 3
  completed = 4


[memo]

- On cancellation, task recognition task is disposed with kAFAssistantErrorDomain error 216 (the operation couldnâ€™t be completed). Interruption does not affect the next task.

- At a minute mark, task is forced to stop accepting new input (RecognitionTaskState goes from 1 to 4) and didFinishRecognition is called. success flag is true.

- Error Domain=kAFAssistantErrorDomain Code=209 "(null)" often appears in consecutive recognition calls when the recognizer tries to start a new task before finishing with the best transcription result.

- Error Domain=kAFAssistantErrorDomain Code=203 "Retry" just seemed to be bad input, but they say its something else https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1951/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40017662
